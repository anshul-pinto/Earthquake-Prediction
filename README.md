# Earthquake-Prediction
Kaggle Competition- Day 1 submission, achiedved 88% accuracy using LSTM network. Model is overfitting, current version of the model is achieving less accuracy but is underfitting. Underfitting is an easier problem to tackle.

Next step : Add features, add a skip to the training dataset, normalize the output column and see if better results are achieved.
